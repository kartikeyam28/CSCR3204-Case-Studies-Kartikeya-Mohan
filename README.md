This repository contains two deep learning projects that demonstrate the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text classification tasks. Both projects are designed with a focus on leveraging fine-tuned embeddings and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) architectures to capture meaningful contextual representations of text.
